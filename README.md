# WebSocket-Chat
Just a test project to learn how to websocket better in golang

## Installation
1. Clone and cd to repo in terminal
2. Run `make websocket`
3. Run `make`
4. Run the binary in `bin/ChatServer`
5. Use the chat by opening `Client-side/index.html`

## Credits
- Most of the code was half-lifted from here: https://github.com/gorilla/websocket/tree/master/examples/chat
- Figured the best way to learn would be deconstruct and reconstruct an existing project
